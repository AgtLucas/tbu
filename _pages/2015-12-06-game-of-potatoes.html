<p>Game created with C++ and <a href="http://www.cocos2d-x.org/" target="_blank">Cocos2D</a>.</p>
<p>In this time I was the <strong>artist</strong>. Most of arts of this game I created using Inkscape and GIMP.</p>

<li><strong>Summary:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Game of Potatoes was created during the second semester of 2015 in the Cross-Platform course. The team was composed by two programmers and one artist (me). The game itself is really simple.</p>
<p>You need to command a potatoes army against other potatoes armies. Some features are missing or weren't implemented because the API reference of Cocos2D is bad. At least we have gained a good experience.</p>
